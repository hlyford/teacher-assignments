To get going locally with repo:

1) Fork and clone locally.

2) Run 'npm install' from command line (there are some server-side dependencies)

3) run 'bower install' from command line (though I also included the client-side dependencies on the github repo)

4) *Server must be started to serve up client-side assets*. Run 'node server/server/js'
